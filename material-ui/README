Changes from prior versions
- Files use Material-UI instead of Bootstrap
- Timer modal is pulled out as separate component

Files needed for testing
- Timer3.tsx
- TimerModal.tsx
- index.js

Sample inputs are submitted on file index.js
- inputs must be compatible with interface 'DatabaseSet' ie {name: string, time: Date, connectionStatus: boolean}
- 3 sample values are currently defined on index.js, connection status may be altered trigger certain behaviors

Expected Behavior
- index.js instantiates a Timer3 component, DatabaseSet structured information as props input
- Timer3 instantites a TimerModal component
