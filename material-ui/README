Changes from prior versions
- Files use Material-UI instead of Bootstrap
- Timer modal is pulled out as separate component

Files needed for testing
- Timer3.tsx
- TimerModal.tsx
- index.js

Inputs
- inputs must be an array of objects compatible with interface 'DatabaseSet' ie {name: string, time: Date, connectionStatus: boolean}
- 3 sample values are currently defined on index.js, connection status may be altered trigger certain behaviors

Expected Behavior
- index.js instantiates a Timer3 component, DatabaseSet structured information as props input
- Timer3 instantites a TimerModal component
- Count up from the time of last timer component load/initialization which is assumed to be the last time the data was pulled from platforms
  -Update in 1 second intervals
- Timer outline/text turns red to indicate error when connection status to any input database returns false
   -Green otherwise
- TimerModal text for inidividual input database turns red to indicate error when connection status to that input database returns false
  - Text black otherwise
